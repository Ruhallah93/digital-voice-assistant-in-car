# Voice Command Recognition System

Welcome to the Voice Command Recognition System project! This repository hosts the source code and resources for a voice command recognition system that utilizes machine learning techniques to identify spoken commands from the audio input.

## Project Overview

The Voice Command Recognition System aims to recognize and classify spoken commands from audio recordings. The system can distinguish between various predefined commands, such as opening doors, windows, or Bluetooth connections, controlling the steering wheel, and more. The project utilizes a combination of natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning (ML) techniques to achieve accurate and reliable command recognition.

## Key Features

- **Audio Processing:** The system is capable of capturing audio input from a microphone, making it suitable for real-world scenarios where voice commands need to be recognized instantly.

- **Command Classification:** Using machine learning models, the system classifies spoken commands into predefined categories, enabling precise command recognition.

- **Unknown Command Handling:** The system includes the ability to handle unknown or ambiguous commands by assigning them a specific "Unknown" label, ensuring robustness and adaptability.


## Project Components

- **Data Preprocessing:** Raw audio data is preprocessed, including feature extraction, to create suitable inputs for machine learning models.

- **Model Training:** Machine learning models are trained on datasets and the best ones are chosen by comparing the classification results. Support Vector Classifier (SVC) was chosen as the best model and trained on the preprocessed data to learn the patterns associated with each command.

- **Real-Time Recognition:** The system captures and processes audio in real-time, predicting the spoken command using the trained models.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies using the provided `requirements.txt` file.
3. Run the system.

## Future Work

- **Enhanced Command Set:** Expand the range of recognized commands to cover a wider spectrum of user interactions.
- **Multilingual Support:** Extend the project to handle commands and instructions in multiple languages. This would require translating and preprocessing text in various languages while maintaining the model's accuracy.
- **Continuous Learning:** Explore techniques to enable the system to learn new commands from user input, enhancing adaptability.
- **Collaborative Filtering:** Implement collaborative filtering techniques to learn from the preferences of different users and adapt the model accordingly.
